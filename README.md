# Steel Detection  

## Written in front  

As my Graduation Design, the project cost me almost 5 months to complete.5 months ago, i was new to deep learning and knew nothing about how to use TensorFlow to solve a computer vision problem.So at least, I'm quiet happy to conque the chanllage though the code of the project is mostly from the APIs supplied from TensoFlow Object Detection.Really appreciate the help of my friends and myriad articles on the Internet.  

## References  

[TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)  

## Main Dependencies  

The environment dependencies of the project mainly includes:  

* **Python3.6.7**  
* **TensorFlow(>=1.12.0)**  
* **opencv**  
* **TensorFlow Object Detection API(0.1.0)**  

## Usage  

### Installation  

For TensorFlow, run :  

'#For GPU(recommended)'  
'pip3 install tensorflow-gpu'  
'#For CPU'  
'pip3 install tensorflow'  

For more details of installation of TenosrFlow, you can visit [Tensorflow installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).  

For OpenCV, run :  

'<pip3 install opencv-python>'  

For TensorFlow Object Detection, visit [TensorFlow Object Detection API Installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md)for the full steps.
